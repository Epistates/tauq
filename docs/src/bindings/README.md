# Language Bindings

Tauq is designed to be ubiquitous. We provide first-class bindings for major languages, ensuring that you can parse, format, and query Tauq data regardless of your tech stack.

All bindings support the core API:
1.  **Parse**: Tauq String → Native Object / JSON
2.  **Format**: Native Object / JSON → Tauq String
3.  **Exec**: Execute Tauq Query (TQQ)
4.  **Minify**: Compress Tauq String

Select your language from the sidebar for specific instructions.
