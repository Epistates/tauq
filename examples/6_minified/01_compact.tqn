# ============================================================================
# Tauq Minified: Compact Syntax
# ============================================================================
#
# Semicolons (;) act as newlines, enabling single-line representations.
# Ideal for streaming, log lines, or embedded configurations.

# --- Schema + Data on One Line ---
!def User id name role; 1 Alice admin; 2 Bob user; 3 Carol user

# --- Mixed Multi-line and Inline ---
!def Point x y
10 20; 30 40; 50 60
70 80
90 100

# --- Inline Objects ---
config { name App; version "1.0"; debug false }

# --- Inline Arrays ---
servers [alpha beta gamma]; ports [80 443 8080]

# --- When to Use Minified ---
# 1. Streaming data (each line = one record)
# 2. Embedding in other formats (shell scripts, logs)
# 3. Maximum token efficiency for LLM context
# 4. Network transmission (smaller payloads)
